Abstract Analysis Classes :
    - User
    - Book
    - Database
    - UI

Elaborated Design Class : User

- Importance : The User class is essential to the project as it represents the core of user-related 
functionality. All other primary classes rely on the structure of a user profile.

- Complexity: The complexity of this class is very high, because of its interconnectedness with all 
other analysis classes, managing data and state dependencies is crucial for our application. 

- Interactivity: The Interactivity of this class is very high,  it must communicate and manage data 
with other key classes, such as Book for user-specific book data, Database for information, and User 
Interface for front-end interactions.

Dashboard/Login/Register Page : 
1. make sure that users cannot access dashboard if they are not logged in 

Bugs :
    1. when users are logged in and on homepage they are redirected to login and not dashboard
        this only happens after the user logs out and logs back in, but if you are initially logged in 
        it works fine ???
